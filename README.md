# Vericode

**A Web3 Coding Test and Certification Platform Based on EDU Chain and Arbitrum with zkVerify**

## Problem Statement

In the current digital landscape, **verifying programming skills** is inefficient, centralized, and lacks reliability.

- Traditional coding test platforms rely on **centralized servers**, posing **data leakage risks** and **privacy concerns**.
- Coding test results and certificates are **prone to forgery**, making them unreliable as proof of skills.
- Developers **struggle to verify and showcase their coding abilities** effectively.

## Solution

Vericode utilizes **zkVerify and Open Campus' EDU Chain** as the primary network while **supporting Arbitrum** to provide a **secure and reliable coding test and verification system**.

- Developers take coding tests, and their results are **verified using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK Proofs)**.
- Successful candidates receive **blockchain-based certificates (NFT/ID cards)** to prove their skills.
- All certification data is **stored on EDU Chain** by default, with **Arbitrum integration** ensuring **scalability and flexibility**.

## Key Features

**1. Privacy-Preserving and Secure Verification on EDU Chain with zkVerify**

- EDU Chain serves as the primary network, ensuring **secure data management**.
- Personal data is **encrypted and verified using ZK Proofs**, preserving **user privacy**.
- The system provides a **tamper-proof verification mechanism** to enhance trust.

**2. Decentralized Coding Test Platform**

- Developers can **take coding tests in a Web3 environment**, supporting various programming languages and difficulty levels.
- Smart contracts ensure **fair and transparent evaluation**.

**3. Blockchain-Based Certification System (EDU Chain + Arbitrum Support)**

- Successful candidates receive **immutable blockchain-based certificates**.
- Certificates are **issued on EDU Chain** and can also be **verified and utilized on Arbitrum** for added flexibility.
- These certifications serve as **proof of skills for employment, hackathons, and developer communities**.

**4. On-Chain Identity Verification and Attestation**

- Open Campus' **EDU Chain** is used to issue **coding certificates and ID cards**.
- Users can leverage these certifications for **job applications, freelance projects, and credibility building in communities**.

**5. Scalability and Cost Efficiency with Arbitrum**

- While EDU Chain serves as the primary network, **Arbitrum enhances scalability and speed**.
- Arbitrum processes **transactions and certificate issuance at low fees with high efficiency**.

## Conclusion

Vericode is a **trustworthy, decentralized, privacy-preserving coding test and verification platform** that leverages **zkVerify, Open Campus EDU Chain, and Arbitrum** to **provide developers with a new way to prove their skills**. ðŸš€





This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
